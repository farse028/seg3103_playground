Make sure you have Java, JavaSDK, Junit, Elixir and Python installed.

To run the code open a Unix-based command line interface (I used git bash).

Navigate to the directory you want to run the code, for example: "./seg3103_playground/newmath_java"  for running the java code.

Run the command: "./bin/run" in the current working directory (cwd) to run the program.

Run the command: "./bin/test" in the CWD to run the test program.
